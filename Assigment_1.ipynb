An HTML comment is written using the special syntax <!-- comment goes here -->. For example, Ravi can write: <!-- This section displays the user profile -->. The browser completely ignores anything inside <!-- and -->, so these notes are never shown to website visitors. Such comments are very useful because they help developers understand the structure or purpose of the code, serve as reminders for future changes, and make it easier for other developers (or even Ravi himself later) to maintain and debug the code. In this way, comments improve the readability, collaboration, and maintainability of HTML files.\n",
